installing SDL2

1. Download the development library of SDL2 and SDL2_image

https://discourse.libsdl.org/t/source-code-runtime-libraries-development-libraries/6401
Source code is the actual source code for SDL. When you compile it, it will
create the SDL libraries (binary) and the header files, etc.

Runtime libraries are the actual SDL source code compiled into a binary.
They are required if you want to run a program that requires SDL, but you are
not actually developing software which requires SDL.

Development libraries are required (as well as the runtime libraries) if you
will be developing software that uses SDL. It normally consists of header
files, etc, that would not normally be required for running an SDL program.

Think of the Java Runtime Environment vs. the Java Software Development Kit
as a comparison.

2. Put the library files in somewhere accessible, and put SDL2_image files inside the library folder as well 

3. Set up tasks/makefile - make sure to include and link SDL2main, SDL2 and SDL2_image form lib

4. put runtime library DLLs in each of the bin folders
